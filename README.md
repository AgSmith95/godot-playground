# This is a repository for learning Godot
I will try to write a game for Android

See [my Godot cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3lxW3lzMZzoOLpEyCaWVUMIZnsYKoiyz4Yx90cBAJw/edit).

To successfully import and build this project for Android you need:
1. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). Don't clone without installing it first because resources will be messed up.
1. Follow steps explained in [Exporting for Android](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html)
